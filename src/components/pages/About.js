          For most of his life Omar has been very active, involved in a wide
          variety of sports such as basketball, soccer, and most recently
          snowboarding & rock climbing. While he has lived most of his life in
          South Florida, he spent four years in Tallahassee pursuing his
          bachelors in marketing. Immediately after college, he obtained his
          real estate license and has been helping families purchase their
          forever homes for almost three years now.

          While that has brought him many rewarding experiences, he has
          frequently felt there has been something missing for his own sense of
          self-fulfillment. He determined that to be his thirst for finding a
          career that was more mentally challenging & demanding. After much
          consideration, speaking to many people in the industry, and getting a
          small taste of web development through Code Academy, where he began
          learning HTML & JavaScript, he decided that this career path would
          make the most sense for him and his short-term & long-term goals. He
          enrolled in the UM coding bootcamp and is excited for what he is to
          learn and be exposed to in the following 6 months.
